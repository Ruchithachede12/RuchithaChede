    <h2>What is HTML and why is it important for web development?</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design webpages. Without HTML, websites could not exist in the form we see today. HTML provides the basic structure of a webpage by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other content. It acts like the skeleton of a webpage, allowing browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari to display content in an organized way. HTML uses tags to identify different parts of the content, but even without tags, its purpose is to describe the meaning and structure of the content. Learning HTML is essential for anyone interested in web development because it is the foundation upon which websites are built. It works together with CSS and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive sites. Knowing HTML helps you understand how the internet works, how content is delivered, and how web browsers interpret and render pages.</p>
    <h2>What are HTML elements and attributes?

</h2>
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document. Each element represents a part of the webpage, like a paragraph, image, or link. Elements are defined by tags, but more importantly, they have content that they represent. Attributes provide additional information about elements. For example, an image element might have an attribute specifying the source file for the picture. Attributes can also control how elements behave or appear, like defining a link’s destination or setting an input field’s placeholder text. Attributes are written inside the opening tag of an element. Together, elements and attributes allow web developers to create rich, detailed webpages. Elements tell the browser what kind of content is present, and attributes customize or enhance that content. This combination makes HTML flexible and powerful for web design and development.</p>
<h2>What is the role of semantic HTML?</h2>
<p>Semantic HTML means using HTML elements according to their intended meaning rather than just for presentation. Semantic tags clearly describe their purpose and content, making the webpage easier to understand for both humans and machines. For example, using a heading element for titles, a paragraph element for blocks of text, or an article element for standalone content. Semantic HTML improves accessibility, helping screen readers and assistive technologies interpret the page properly. It also enhances search engine optimization by helping search engines understand the content and its hierarchy better. Using semantic HTML leads to cleaner, more maintainable code that is easier to debug and update</p>
<h2> How does HTML structure a webpage?</h2>
<p>HTML structures a webpage by dividing the content into different parts. It organizes information in a hierarchical manner, starting with titles and subtitles, then paragraphs, lists, images, and links. The structure allows browsers to display content in a meaningful order. For example, headings show the main topics, while paragraphs provide details. Lists group related items, such as bullet points or numbered steps. Links connect different pages or sections. Images add visual interest and convey information visually. HTML uses containers to group related elements so they stay together on the page. This structural layout helps browsers render the content properly and users navigate the site easily. It also makes the page more accessible for tools that read aloud or display content in different formats.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between block-level and inline elements?</h2>
<p>Block-level elements create larger, separate sections in a webpage and usually start on a new line. They take up the full width available and stack vertically. Examples include paragraphs, headings, and divisions that group content. Block elements are used to organize content into chunks that can be styled or positioned independently. Inline elements, by contrast, do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include links, bold text, or images within a paragraph. Inline elements are used to style or link small pieces of content inside a block. Understanding this difference is key for controlling layout and spacing on a webpage. Block-level elements structure the page vertically, while inline elements structure content horizontally inside blocks. Together, they allow complex and visually appealing designs.
